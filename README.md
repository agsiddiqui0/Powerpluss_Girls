The player - a masked adventurer from the underground - is tasked with exploring the outside world, set in a post-climate change era. 
The player visits four different tribes from the outside world, each with unique characteristics. 
Acquainting themselves with each respective culture, going on side quests, interacting with unique, quirky NPCs, and ultimately finding the "orb" of each tribe, "AfterWorld" immerses the player in an experience like no other. 

Controls: Use WASD to move, and press SPACE to proceed through dialogue!
