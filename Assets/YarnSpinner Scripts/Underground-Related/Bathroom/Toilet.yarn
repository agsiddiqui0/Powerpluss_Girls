title: Toilet
---
A pristine, polished toilet, with a slightly suspicious green aura. 
-> Lift the lid – it might have a slip!
	Bestowed upon you is the wondrous, glorious sight of the aftermath of the chief's indigestion after having consumed one too many burritos from Taco Drill. Your senses are overwhelmed by the intense intertwining of many scents and sights all at once.
-> EUGHH! How do you forget to flush, especially after a mess like THAT!?!
-> I'm not sure I wanna see what's in there…
