<color=red> The floor is destroyed. </color>
<color=red> It's decorated with the bones of my people. </color>
<color=red> This must be the doing of all those bizarre species. </color>
<color=red> If I had known they were our resources... </color>
<color=red> If only I had known they were willing to kill to obtain our resources because they were running out too... </color>
<color=red> But it's too late now. </color>
<color=red> Goodnight, everyone. </color>
