Sigh, it's you again.
-> What's with the attitude?
-> I know you missed me. Winks
Whatever. What are you here to pester me about this time? 
-> Just checking in on my favorite librarian~
I'm the ONLY librarian hereâ€¦ Seriously, what do you need?
-> Chief might have lost a slip of paper with a number on it around here. Have you seen anything?
Can't say I have. Try checking around here or the seating area, he was dawdling around those locations the most.
-> I knew I could rely on you!
Save it.
