Blythe: Have you met my little sister?
->Yea, she's a silly little kid.
    Blythe: No she's annoying.
->No, I'm guessing it's the kid that looks almost identical to you?
    Zoe: Yeaaaa, pretty obvious right? Unfortunately I need to take care of her because our parents are 3mm tall.
    Zoe: Whatever, such is the life of a velella.
