Hoodi: I'm playing hide and seek with my sisters!
->How fun!
    Hoodi: Yea, whoever can find each other the fastest gets to eat the others!!
    Hoodi: Don't worry we can grow our whole body back from our heads!
->I don't think you'll win from just standing around.
    Hoodi: Yea...I've been searching for so long I already know I'm in last place.
    Hoodi: I don't want to be eaten...
