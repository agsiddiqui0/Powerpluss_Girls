Porty: I'm so excited for the museum opening I'm gonna eat my hat.
->You don't have a hat.
    Porty: It's a figure of speech, do you even have those in your city?
    Porty: Although I'm not sure what a hat is...
->Have fun!
    Porty: Thank you, I'm buying all the cranial head protectors there!!
Arboc: I heard they fished up a giant pearl that fell into the sea, isn't that exciting?
