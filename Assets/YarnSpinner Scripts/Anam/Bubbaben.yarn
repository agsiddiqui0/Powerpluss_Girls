Bubbaben: ♫ Hi ho! Hi ho! ♫ Our worries are no more! ♫ By spreading joy and spreading cheer, the storm lord makes sure we're all here! ♫ 
Bubbaben: ♫ Without joy and without cheer, we'd all perish, writhing in fear! ♫
-> Wow uh, nice song?
Bubbaben: Thanks partner! You'd better hurry on over! The ceremony is probably happenin' about now!
