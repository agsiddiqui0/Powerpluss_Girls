Around the World in 8 Days
Ah! An adventurous classic! Unfortunately for the protagonist, I can cut down that time to just 7 days and 23 hours! 
Librarian: Actually, humans circumnavigated the world in less than 2 days in their prime. 
What? What do you mean people flew around the world in less than 2 days!?
